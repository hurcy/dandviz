                    <p>PISA measures performance only among 15-year-olds who are enrolled in education. In 2012, PISA
                    covers 65 countries and economies,including all 34 OECD countries and 31 partner countries and
                    economies. PISA also measures index of economic, social and cultural status, so called ESCS. It was
                    created on the basis of the following variables: the highest levels of occupational status of the
                    student's parents, the highest level of education of the student's parents, family wealth, etc.</p>
                    <p>According to the PISA report, we can see socio-economic status and performance in two
                    aspects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How well socio-economic status predicts performance</li>
                        <li>How much impact of socio-economic status to performance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The strength of the relationship between performance and socio-economic status varies
                    across countries, so it is hard to compare the performance between countries. On average
                    across OECD countries, a more socio-economically advantaged student scores 39 points higher
                    in mathematics – the equivalent of nearly one year of schooling – than a less-advantaged
                    student.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the countries with strong relationship between performance and
                    socio-economic status also tend to have big performance gap across socio-economic status.
                    On the other hand, the countires with weak relationship between them are likely have small
                    performance gap across socio-economic status.</p>
                    <p>To compare math performance between different education systems, this visualization
                    focuses on comparisons based on the performance of students with similar socio-economic
                    status.</p>

                    <p>To do this, we need to assume that all students had the same OECD-average socio-economic status,
                    and then compare the math scores between countries.</p>
                    <p>Most education systems perform similarly before and after accounting for socio-economic status.
                    However, some ranks are changed considerably. I selected the cases that more than 10 positions
                    changed, you can find out the next tabs.</p>

                    If socio-economic status were taken into account, rankings of mnay countries are increased. In
                    particular, three countries that would climb more than 10 positions in their performance rankings.
