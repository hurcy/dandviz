                    <p>PISA measures performance only among 15-year-olds who are enrolled in education. PISA 2012 covers 65 countries and economies,including all 34 OECD countries and 31 partner countries and economies. In addition, PISA measures index of economic, social and cultural status, so called ESCS. It was created on the basis of the following variables: the highest levels of occupational status of the student's parents, the highest level of education of the student's parents, family wealth, etc.</p>
                    <p>
                    While many socio-economically disadvantaged achieve at high levels on the PISA assessment, <b>socio-economic status is still a strong predictor of performance in many countries.</b> Performance gap due to socio-economic status varies across countries. Socio-economically disadvantaged students and schools tend to get lower score than their disadvantaged peers by larger margins than between any other two groups of students. PISA result report said:
                    <blockquote> Still, socio-economic status is <b><big>NOT DESTINY</big></b>: many countries and economies that have seen improvements in their mean performance on PISA have also managed to weaken the link between socio-economic status and performance. </blockquote>

                    <p>So, I would like to response the question: <b><big>Which countries beat the socio-ecomonic circumstances?</big></b>

                    <p>
                    To do this, we need to assume that all students had the same OECD-average socio-economic status(ESCS*), and then compare the math scores between countries. Most education systems perform similarly before and after accounting for socio-economic status. However, some ranks are changed considerably. I selected the cases that more than 10 positions changed, you can find out the next tabs.

                    These are the only three countries that would climb more than 10 positions in their performance rankings if socio-economic status were taken into account.
