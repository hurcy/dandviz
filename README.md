# Summary
What would be the average performance of education system if all students had the OECD-average socio-economic status(ESCS*)?
You can find ranking of observed math scores on the left side, and ranking of adjusted math scores on the right. Most education systems perform similarly before and after accounting for socio-economic status. However, these are the only three countries that would climb more than 10 positions in their performance rankings if socio-economic status were taken into account. 
Portugal would perform above the OECD average if socio-economic status were taken into account. Turkeyâ€™s performance would also improve from below average to average. Among the partner economies, Viet Nam would markedly improve its rankings if socio-economic status were taken into account.

* ESCS refers to the PISA index of economic, social and cultural status. It was created on the basis of the following variables: the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI); the highest level of education of the student's parents, converted into years of schooling.

# Design
I would like to visualize ranking changes when socio-economic status were taken into account. Slopegraph is the best type of graph to show comparisons between two rankings.
